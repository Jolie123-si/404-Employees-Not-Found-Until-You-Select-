# 📊 Employee Data Analysis — Oracle SQL Breakdown

This document offers a comprehensive theoretical overview of the operations performed in the Employee Data Analysis project using **Oracle SQL**. It focuses solely on the *conceptual logic* behind each query and function—actual SQL code is presented at the end for implementation purposes.

---

## ✅ 1. Checking for Table Existence
Before creating the `EMPLOYEES` table, we first check if it already exists in the database. This step prevents redundancy and execution errors caused by attempting to create an already existing table.

---

## 🏗️ 2. Creating the EMPLOYEES Table
The `EMPLOYEES` table was designed with a realistic HR schema, including the following fields:

- **EmployeeID**: Unique identifier for each employee.
- **EmployeeName**: Full name of the employee.
- **Department**: Department assignment (e.g., IT, HR).
- **Salary**: Monthly salary.
- **JoinDate**: The date when the employee joined.

---

## ✍🏽 3. Inserting Data
Sample records were inserted to simulate a realistic organizational structure, including 7 employees distributed between the **IT** and **HR** departments. This dataset enables practical demonstrations of SQL functions.

---

## 👁️ 4. Viewing Employee Records
A basic query is used to view all records. This acts as a quick validation step to confirm successful data insertion and offers a snapshot of the current dataset.

---

## 🔁 5. Salary Comparison Using `LAG()`
The `LAG()` analytic function helps compare an employee’s salary with the *previous* employee's salary within the same department. This backward-looking comparison is essential for:

- Analyzing historical salary trends.
- Detecting pay progression or inconsistency.

---

## 🔁 6. Salary Comparison Using `LEAD()`
Conversely, the `LEAD()` function allows a *forward-looking* salary comparison. It reveals how current employees’ pay stacks up against their immediate successors within the department.

---

## 🏅 7. `RANK()` vs `DENSE_RANK()`
We used both ranking functions to sort employees by salary within departments:

- `RANK()` introduces gaps if there are ties.
- `DENSE_RANK()` assigns consecutive ranks even when ties occur.

These tools are useful for defining **tiers**, such as performance bands or eligibility for promotions.

---

## 🥇 8. Top 3 Earners per Department
A Common Table Expression (CTE) and window functions were used to extract the **top 3 highest-paid employees** in each department. This analysis is often used for **bonus qualification**, **executive targeting**, or **performance recognition**.

---

## ⏳ 9. First Two Joiners per Department
Using department-wise date sorting, we identified the **first two employees to join** each department. This helps in recognizing long-term contributors and determining seniority levels.

---

## 💵 10. Maximum Salary Insights
We derived:

- The **maximum salary per department**.
- The **overall maximum salary** across the entire company.

This data is vital for **compensation benchmarking** and **budget planning**.

---

## 🌟 11. Highlighting Max Earners by Department
Lastly, we filtered out employees who earn the **highest salary in their department**. These standout individuals are excellent candidates for recognition or leadership roles.

---

## 🧠 Summary
This breakdown demystifies the logic and purpose behind each SQL operation in the Employee Data project. Whether you're a collaborator, instructor, or HR analyst, this serves as a foundational guide to understanding *why* each query was written.

## 💻 SQL Code Implementation

```sql
-- 1. Checking for Existing Table
SELECT table_name 
FROM user_tables
WHERE table_name = 'EMPLOYEES';

-- 2. Creating the EMPLOYEES Table
CREATE TABLE EMPLOYEES (
    EmployeeID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    EmployeeName VARCHAR2(100),
    Department VARCHAR2(50),
    Salary NUMBER(8, 2),
    JoinDate DATE
);

-- 3. Inserting Sample Data
INSERT INTO EMPLOYEES (EmployeeID, EmployeeName, Department, Salary, JoinDate)
VALUES (1, 'Alice', 'IT', 9000, TO_DATE('2021-03-15', 'YYYY-MM-DD'));
-- (Other insert statements...)

-- 4. View All Records
SELECT * FROM EMPLOYEES;

-- 5. Salary Comparison with Previous Employee
SELECT 
    EmployeeID, EmployeeName, Department, Salary,
    LAG(Salary) OVER (PARTITION BY Department ORDER BY Salary) AS PrevSalary,
    LEAD(Salary) OVER (PARTITION BY Department ORDER BY Salary) AS NextSalary,
    CASE 
        WHEN Salary > LAG(Salary) OVER (PARTITION BY Department ORDER BY Salary) THEN 'HIGHER'
        WHEN Salary < LAG(Salary) OVER (PARTITION BY Department ORDER BY Salary) THEN 'LOWER'
        ELSE 'EQUAL' 
    END AS ComparisonWithPrev
FROM Employees;

-- 6. Comparison with Next Salary (LEAD)
-- (Similar query with LEAD logic)

-- 7. Ranking Employees
SELECT 
    EmployeeID, EmployeeName, Department, Salary,
    RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY Department ORDER BY Salary DESC) AS Rank,
    DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY Department ORDER BY Salary DESC) AS DenseRank
FROM Employees;

-- 8. Top 3 Earners Per Department
WITH RankedEmployees AS (
    SELECT EmployeeID, EmployeeName, Department, Salary,
           RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY Department ORDER BY Salary DESC) AS Rank
    FROM Employees
)
SELECT * FROM RankedEmployees WHERE Rank <= 3;

-- 9. First Two Joiners Per Department
-- (Query using ROWNUM and UNION ALL for IT and HR)

-- 10. Maximum Salary Insights
SELECT 
    EmployeeID, EmployeeName, Department, Salary,
    MAX(Salary) OVER (PARTITION BY Department) AS MaxSalaryPerDept,
    MAX(Salary) OVER () AS MaxSalaryOverall
FROM Employees;

-- 11. Highlight Max Earners Per Department
SELECT *
FROM (
    SELECT EmployeeID, EmployeeName, Department, Salary,
           MAX(Salary) OVER (PARTITION BY Department) AS MaxSalaryPerDept
    FROM Employees
)
WHERE Salary = MaxSalaryPerDept;
```
